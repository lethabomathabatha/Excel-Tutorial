## Bike Sales Dashboard
This dashboard is based on the 'Excel Project Dataset.xlsx' dataset. This datasets gives insight on bike sales based demographics such as **Age**, **Gender**, **Income**, **Home Ownership**, **Region**, **Commute Distance**, and more.

This project was aimed at generating an interactive Excel dashboard to allow a user to easily filter and analyse the data and gain insights into bike sales. 

The project can simply be broken down into these, partly iterative, steps:
* **Data Cleaning** - removing duplicates, finding and resolving critical typos, type formatting, case formatting, filling missing values, data grouping
* **Pivot Table Additions** - building pivot tables with cleaned dataset to summarize relationships between data groups to generate useful insight reports
* **Chart Additions** - creating charts to visualise patterns, trends and comparisons formed from the pivot tables
* **Dashboard Creation** - copy charts onto new worksheet, use Slicer to create filters, utilize 'Report Connections' to make the filters apply to relevant pivot tables (and in extension, relevant charts)
