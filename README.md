## Bike Sales Dashboard
This dashboard is based on the 'Excel Project Dataset.xlsx' dataset. This dataset gives insight on bike sales based demographics such as **Age**, **Gender**, **Income**, **Home Ownership**, **Region**, **Commute Distance**, and more.

This project was aimed at generating an interactive Excel dashboard to allow a user to easily filter and analyse the data and gain insights into bike sales. 

The project can simply be broken down into these iterative steps:
* **Data Cleaning** - removing duplicates, finding and resolving critical typos, type formatting, case formatting, filling missing values, data grouping
* **Pivot Table Additions** - building pivot tables with cleaned dataset to summarize relationships between data groups to generate useful insight reports
* **Chart Additions** - creating charts to visualise patterns, trends and comparisons formed from the pivot tables
* **Dashboard Creation** - copy charts onto new worksheet, use Slicer to create filters, utilize 'Report Connections' to make the filters apply to relevant pivot tables (and in extension, relevant charts)

## Key Features
* **Interactive Slicers**: allow for instant data filtering based on **Gender**, **Marital Status**, **Region**, and **Education**. Additional filters can be added as needed.
* **User-Friendly Interface**: simple chart types to ensure easy visual data extraction, navigation and accessibility. The consistent use of keys and filters also makes it easy to identitfy trends and patterns in the data.
